# TermProject
O.S. Spring 2020

This project was worked on over the course of the spring 2020 semester. It was worked on by Josh Balzer and myself Ethan Senor. It was assigned and assisted by Dr. Robert Kramer. 
The project takes a virtual disk image, vdi file, and is able to extract files within the vdi file and also write files back into them. This invoves a lot of low level
programming and the knowledge on how files are stored on a linux based system. This project was unfortunatly not completed fully and is still being worked on for total completion.
